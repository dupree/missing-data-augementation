    "    -  Since the data/keywords in title field is limited to 4-5 keywords, this approach seems fairly starightforward and compuationally less expensive.\n",
    "    -  If the title itself contains keywords such as - Internship, Entry(Jr.), Senior(Sr.) then return these specific keywords as the seniority level.  \n",
    "    -  If not, **title** of the incomplete offer information can be matched with rest of available job titles and the seniority level of the closest matching title can be inferred as the seniority level of the incomplete offer information.\n",
    "    -  a variety of **text similarity algorithms** can be utilized for this task such as: term frequency based method **tf/idf** and word vectors based methods such as **smooth inverse frequency, word movers distance (WMD)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Inferring using Description**:  This task grows in complexity since the job description (may) contain a lot of additional data regarding the company and work profile. In this case task can be broken down into further substeps:\n",
    "    -  extract job description as a list of sentences.\n",
    "    -  if the job description contains keyword \"intern\", \"internship\" then assign it as Internship level. \n",
    "    -  find out the **sentence that contains keywords of interest: \"years\", \"experience\".** \n",
    "    -  extract the numeric value in this sentence(**POS** might help here) and based on this number assign a category to the seniority level. For eg. Entry level: 0-2 years, Mid level: 3-5 years and Senior level: 5+ years\n",
    "    \n",
    "**NOTE**: I do NOT think, finding similarity among different **offer descriptions**(using tf/idf or word/sentence embedding methods) and then assigning the seniority level of closest matching offer description to the missing offfer value will lead to favourable results. Since there will be high similarity among jobs posted by same organisation with different seniority levels.  \n",
